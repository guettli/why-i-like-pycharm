Why I like PyCharm
------------------

Just some notes what I want to add to my talk at Chemnitzer Linux Tage 2017

https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2017/en/programm/beitrag/270

Intro
-----

“Somewhere beyond right and wrong, there is a garden. I will meet you there.” 
This is not a "PyCharm vs vi" battle!

This is just why I like it. I guess vi and emacs can do the same.

File editing
------------

Changes in file (green bar if new, small gray triangle for deletions).

git
---

history for selection (via ctrl-shift-a "hist sel")

searching
---------

shift-shift TERM

ctrl-shift-f full-text search
