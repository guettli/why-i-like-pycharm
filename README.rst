Community Edition is enough.

ctrl-shift-a "Default Test Runner": pytest. Now you have a green triangle to the right of tests to execute particular test methods.

ctrl-click on method to see its usage. Configure it to exclude imports. I usualy use real usages, not imports.

Don't waste too much time in the debugger. Write tests.
