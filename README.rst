Why I like PyCharm
------------------

Some random notes

Community Edition is enough (which is free). I don't need the professional version.

shift-shift: Search eveywhere. Look at the top: All, Classes, Files, Symbols, Actions, Git.

ctrl-shift-a: Like shift-shift then "Actions".

strg-alt-shift l --> reformat code

Handling git merge conflicts is better with PyCharm than the tool Meld: If two commits added roughly the same, you see the difference
between both new versions.

Refactor/Extract/Method

ctrl-shift-f: Like ctrl-f (find), but in all files.

ctrl-shift-r: Like ctrl-r (replace), but in all files.

shift-shift "hist sel" --> History for Selection. Great!

Configuration: I reduce the font-size of non-code. And I increase (and change) the font-size of the code. 
Again "shift-shift font" will bring you to the place for configuring this.

alt-shift cursor left/right: Navigate through the code places you visited during the last minutes.

ctrl-e: List of last files: I like this to "blindly" jump between two files. Usualy production-code and test-code.

Execute pytest directly. You need to change the default test-runner first.

Execute Django's runserver: Run / Edit Configuration / add ...

ctrl-click on method name: Find usage/definition.

Not commit changes are highlighted with a green bar. You can easily get back to the original (or show the diff).

comments are in lightgray. I like this. Comments are less important than code.

unused variables are visible, since they are lightgray.

copy+paste history (But I prefer CopyQ which is a clipboard manager for the whole desktop, not just the IDE).

Debugger (I try to avoid it. I prefer to write tests and assertions).

Integrated terminal. But [IDEA-155783 "Alt ." not working](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-155783)
