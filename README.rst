Why I like PyCharm
------------------

Just some notes what I want to add to my talk at Chemnitzer Linux Tage 2017

https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2017/en/programm/beitrag/270

Intro
-----

“Somewhere beyond right and wrong, there is a garden. I will meet you there.” 
This is not a "PyCharm vs vi" battle!

This is just why I like it. I guess vi and emacs can do the same.

File editing
------------

Changes in file (green bar if new, small gray triangle for deletions).

strg-o (inside a class) --> Provide list of methods which could be **o**verridden.

git
---

history for selection (via ctrl-shift-a "hist sel")

searching
---------

shift-shift TERM

ctrl-shift-f full-text search

open source?
------------

I don't know if pyCharm is open source or not. I don't care. I don't use it as library.

I care of all libraries I use for my code: I avoid GPL and like BSD-like licences.

(comparison: I would by PhotoShop if it would run on linux. I use, but don't like gimp)

See unneeded or broken code
---------------------------

PyCharm paints unneeded variables light-gray and syntax errors in eye catching red.

I like this.
